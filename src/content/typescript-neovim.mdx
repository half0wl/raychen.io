This is a rave about neovim.

I've been using (neo)vim for nearly a decade now. Investing my time into
learning how to operate it was the best decision I've made, as far as tech
skills goes.

It gives me super speed when editing. It’s lightweight and distraction-free.
It enables me to take full advantage of my "flow moments" by helping me work
faster. It runs in Terminal, my native environment for everything; I don't
have to choose between my editor or Terminal, or jankily embed a Terminal
into my editor. It lightens the load on my wrists since I never have to use
the mouse when editing or writing (which is a huge life-saver when working on
laptops!)

## My set-up

* [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) for directory navigation
* [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) + a language server to turn
neovim into an IDE.
    * This gives me everything the language server offers: completion, goto
      definition, etc.
    * For TypeScript, I'm using [neoclide/coc-tsserver](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-tsserver)
    * You can find my coc.nvim config [here](https://github.com/half0wl/nvim/blob/master/coc-settings.json)
* [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) for fuzzy search (filename and contents), [powered by ripgrep](https://github.com/half0wl/nvim/blob/master/init.vim#L108)

You can find all of my neovim config [here](https://github.com/half0wl/nvim).

## Here's what I can do!

### Auto-complete

`CTRL` + `N` allows me to cycle through completions, with a small window
displaying type information and docstrings.
